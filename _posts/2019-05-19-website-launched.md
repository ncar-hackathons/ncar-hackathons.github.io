Thanks to [Dean Attali](http://deanattali.com), NCAR Hackathons now has a website. This is still an early draft, and more sections and material will be added over the weeks to come.

It now contains several sections including:

- a new page about [events](../events)
- a new page about the [resources](../resources)
- a new page about [projects](../projects)
- a [blog](../blog) section.
